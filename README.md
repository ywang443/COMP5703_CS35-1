# Project Title: Mobile platform for restaurant reservation

# Project Description and Scope:
The main purpose of this project is to develop a mobile app as a platform for booking many
participating restaurants. The users of this app can be divided into two groups. One is the customers
of the restaurants, and the other is the owners (or managers) of the restaurants. Customers can
search the restaurants, check the seat availability, and make a booking. The owners of the restaurant 
can set up their seating arrangement and make a real-time update of seat availability. In addition,
due to possible Covid 19 precautions and rules in the future, this app will allow every restaurant to
flexibly adjust its seating arrangement accordingly.

# Expected outcomes/deliverables:
The expected outcome/deliverable is a fully functioning and user-friendly mobile app for both
restaurant owners and customers.

# Specific required knowledge, skills, and/or technology:
Assumed/required knowledge and skills: Students should have the ability to design, develop, code,
and program an Android-based mobile application.
